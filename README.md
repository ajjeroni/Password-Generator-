# Password-Generator-

## Description

For this project, students were given the task to complete an already built password generator code in JavaScript. The acceptance criteria was to make a series of prompts for the password criteria when the user interacts with a button, like password length and optional characters. 

Overall, this was the hardest code to complete up to date since JavaScript is fairly new to me. But building the prompts, the master variable, if loops, and random generator in JavaScript was a fun endeavor. This is something I will have to get used too, since JavaScript is how a user interacts with the webstite.
